# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Binary search in a sorted 1D array
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- The Binary search is a pretty striaght forward data structure. Finding a midpoint and continuing a divide and conquer path is the main way to create a BST. 
 - Big O - Time: O(logn) Space: O(1)
