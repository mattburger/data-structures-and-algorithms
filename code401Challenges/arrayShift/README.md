# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Insert a value in the middle of an array of n elements.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Create a new array newARR of size inputArray.length + 1 and determine midpoint of inputArray. Use a conditional to insert new value at the midpoint of newArr. Space and time complexity it O(N), respectively.
